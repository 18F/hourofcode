# README

This is the GitHub repository for [https://pages.18f.gov/hourofcode/index.html](https://pages.18f.gov/hourofcode/index.html), a site that enables new users of Github to practice editing a Github repository.

Follow [these instructions](https://pages.18f.gov/hourofcode/addyourname.html) to practice editing a Github Repo!

You may see this repository outside of the [18F organization on Github](https://github.com/18f). That means that others have [forked the respository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)!

# Past Use

This was previously a repo for the microsite for [18F's Hour of Code](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/18f-hour-of-code-tickets-14902141707), which featured the same activity (among others).

This is my pull request.
