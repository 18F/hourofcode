# RETIRED

This was the GitHub repository for Hour of Code, a site that enabled new users of Github to practice editing a Github repository.

You may see this repository outside of the [18F organization on Github](https://github.com/18f). That means that others have [forked the respository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)!

# Past Use

This was previously a repo for the microsite for [18F's Hour of Code](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/18f-hour-of-code-tickets-14902141707), which featured the same activity (among others).

This is my edit. This is very helpful because I have always been confused of what a fork is vs. a straight up change when I have access to change.
